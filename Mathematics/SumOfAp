/*
prob:
A series with same common difference is known as arithmetic series. 
The first term of series is 'a' and common difference is d.
The series looks like a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, . . . .
Find the sum of series.
Input:
The first line consists of an integer T i.e number of test cases.
The first line and only line of each test case consists of three values a,d,n.
Output:
Print the sum of the series. With two decimal places.
